# Daemon Console
A flexible console for daemon applications.

## Develop
For example, please read the source code: https://github.com/Mooling0602/Daemon_Console_Rust/blob/main/src/main.rs

## Usage
### For normal users
> Developers can share this part immediately to your users.
- Use keys like `↑↓` to switch command history, `←→` to move the cursor to edit the command input texts.
- Use `Ctrl+D` or `Ctrl+C`(twice to confirm) to exit the console.

### For developers: Install and import this to your projects.
Please wait for a stable release first.
